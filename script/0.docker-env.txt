# To switch back to your default Docker daemon after using Minikube’s,
# you just need to unset the environment variables
# that were set by the eval $(minikube docker-env) command.
# You can do this by closing your current terminal and opening a new one.
# The environment variables set by the eval command are only valid in the current shell,
# so they won’t affect new shells.
# If you want to unset them without closing your terminal, you can use the following commands:
unset DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY
unset DOCKER_HOST
unset DOCKER_CERT_PATH
unset MINIKUBE_ACTIVE_DOCKERD

eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)
